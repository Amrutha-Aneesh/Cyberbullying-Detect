<p>The Internet brings a plethora of advantages to people from all walks of life, but it isn’t without some degree of peril. While it better connects the world and democratizes information, the Internet also allows individuals to hide behind a mask of anonymity.</p>

<p>  According to a study from the Pew Research Center, 95% of teens are connected to the internet, of which 85% are social media users. As a majority of teens have access to the internet, they are increasingly susceptible to online attacks such as cyberbullying and cyberstalking.</p> 

<p>   The study reveals that a majority of cyberbullying incidents take place on popular social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. As a result of cyberbullying, the victims have developed social anxiety, depression, and engaged in self-harm.</p>

<p>   With over 45% of children admitting to having experienced bullying online, only 2 in 10 victims inform their parents or teachers of such online attacks. This goes to show the increasing need for awareness regarding the menace and how parents should educate their children about such online dangers. Observe Stop Cyberbullying Day this June 19th and spread the message among your friends and family.</p>
